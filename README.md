I am a college student majoring in computer science, and this is a collection of some classic machine learning code in the process of learning machine learning, including python files and jupyter notebook files, etc., for reference only.

Currently, the cases included in this folder are: decision tree algorithm, support vector machine algorithm, KNN algorithm, regularized regression algorithm, random forest regression algorithm and K-means algorithm. Other classical machine learning algorithms are being updated, and I'm trying to update them every one to two days.

It is being updated in real time.

If you have any advice or need some help in machine learning,please contact me via email "3370422610@qq.com".

Thank you for your reading.
