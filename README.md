I am a college student majoring in computer science, and this is a collection of some classic machine learning code in the process of learning machine learning, including python files and jupyter notebook files, etc., for reference only.
It is being updated in real time.
If you have any advice or need some help in machine learning,please contact me via email "3370422610@qq.com".
